<h1>Java Micro-Programs For the SCJP/OCP Exam</h1>
<p>As I've been studying for the Sun Certified Java Programmer exam and I've found that some topics and concepts just aren't sticking. I've begun keeping a study log of problem areas and I'm writing some code for every topic or concept I'm confused about. Hopefully some of these will be helpful to others who have difficulty mastering the exam content.</p>
